# Contacts Manager - React Project

This project is a Contacts Manager application built with React and React Router. It demonstrates various aspects of client-side routing, data handling, and UI management. The app allows users to create, edit, search, and delete contact records while providing a seamless user experience. Below is a breakdown of the key features and the steps involved in building this project:

=> Features

1. Client-Side Routing: Implemented using React Router for efficient navigation between different parts of the app.
2. Adding a Router: Set up routing to manage multiple pages in the app, including the root route and nested routes.
3. Handling Not Found Errors: Implemented custom 404 pages to handle cases where users navigate to an unknown route.
4. The Contact Route UI: Developed a dynamic UI to display contact details, leveraging Reactâ€™s component structure.
5. Nested Routes: Efficiently handled nested routes for viewing individual contacts within a list of contacts.
6. Loading Data: Used loaders to fetch and manage contact data, ensuring smooth data retrieval and rendering.
7. Data Writes + HTML Forms: Implemented form handling for creating and updating contacts with form data submission.
8. Creating Contacts: Added functionality to create new contacts, including form validation and data persistence.
9. URL Params in Loaders: Utilized URL parameters to load specific contact details dynamically.
10. Updating Contacts with FormData: Handled form submissions using FormData for updating existing contact details.
11. Optimistic UI Updates: Improved the user experience by reflecting changes immediately before they are confirmed by the server.
12. Global Pending UI: Managed global UI updates to indicate loading or pending states during data mutations.
13. Deleting Records: Added the ability to delete contacts and handle data removal both visually and in the backend.
14. Contextual Error Handling: Implemented error boundaries to display contextual errors during data fetches or mutations.
15. Index Routes: Utilized index routes for default child routes, improving the navigation flow.
16. URL Search Params: Managed search parameters in the URL to filter and search contacts without full page reloads.
17. GET Submissions with Client-Side Routing: Submitted form data as GET requests while keeping the app SPA-friendly.
18. Form Synchronization with URL: Synchronized form state with the URL, allowing better browser navigation (forward/back).
19. Submit onChange: Enabled dynamic form submission on input changes to provide real-time updates.
20. Managing the History Stack: Controlled browser history and navigation, ensuring user-friendly navigation flow.
21. Pathless Routes: Utilized pathless routes to manage navigation without affecting the URL directly.
